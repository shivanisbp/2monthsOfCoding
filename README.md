# 6monthsOfCoding
I am starting this journey of coding from 11th November 2020 for the next 6 months. Hope I don't stop till that, and after that.

#Rules:
1. You can't skip. It's just 6 months, can't be that hard. Exception: If you fall sick (which you don't usually so...).
2. Add all the codes to this repository everyday, along with Question link.
3. Try not to be demotivated, you are gonna have those days, but stay strong, hardwork never goes in vain.
4. Don't feel bad about others doing good, you are gonna get there too, even if it's a little late, but you will. 
5. Follow the plan, please. Extremely important.
